### Hi, I'm Hunter

🚀 Software Engineer | Cloud-Native Systems | Full-Stack Development

I build scalable, production-grade systems across web, mobile, and cloud environments.

- Languages: Python, Java, TypeScript/JavaScript, C#, Go
- Frameworks: React, Angular, Express, ASP.NET Core
- Cloud & Data: AWS, Azure, Docker, PostgreSQL, SQL Server

💻 Currently studying Computer Science in Boston.

Most of my work focuses on end-to-end system design — integrating UI/UX, distributed services, and database architecture into reliable, high-availability platforms.

Many of my larger systems are built for private clients and deployed in production environments, which is why several repositories are private.

Interested in:

- Cloud-native architecture
- Backend systems & APIs
- High-performance web applications
- Machine learning systems
